# Twitter-Sentiment-Ananlysis

Model of Tweets from Twitter.

This dataset is not made by me it has been downloaded online.

Preprocessed the data using regular expression, made WordCloud of All the words, Positive Words, Negative Words, Plotted number of tweets from neagative and positive hashtags and made a Bag of Words & TF-IDF Features model on the dataset. Then made a classifier by applying Logistic regression (Machine Learning approcah) to classify the dataset in positive and negative. 

Here are the WordCloud and Graphs.
